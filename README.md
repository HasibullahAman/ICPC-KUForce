# ICPC-KUForce
In this section, we have the codes that I have solved to prepare for the Kabul regional ICPC exam, the questions are all in the same language and that is in Python, and the reason is because I am fluent in this language. I have collected and solved the questions of this collection from different sites that operate in this section.
